						<p>On March 7, 1876, Bell became the first inventor to receive a US patent for the technology that powered the telephone. Working with his assistant, Thomas Watson, Bell initially had a different goal in mind: to develop a “harmonic telegraph” that could send a number of messages at the same time, each at its own pitch. But after an accidental discovery, in which Watson electrified a vibrating reed on the telegraph, Bell and Watson created a device using vibration to produce and receive sound waves through electrical signals.

						<p>The telephone has had a big impact on the world. When it was first introduced, it could only be afforded by the rich as the materials needed for connection were very expensive. The telephone changed the way social relationship and social interaction take place. Communication over the telephone broadened the range of people one could interact with. Long distance relationships became possible. Keeping close bond with families and communities became possible.

						<p>In the early days of telephony, callers spoke to a switchboard operator at a Central Office who then connected a cord to the proper circuit in order to complete the call. The operators usually served the same small group of customers every day. This created an intimacy between client and customer as customers grew to recognize operators’ voices. In many areas, operators could be counted on to have all sorts of information on hand, such as latest news, weather, sports results, correct time of the day, and even gossip.

						<p>Our building was the focal point of chitchat back in the day, and we are trying to stay true to our roots. The hostel has a strong social aspect, with multiple common areas, terrace and cafeteria where both internationals and locals can hang out. Altogether, atmosphere we created in the hostel is friendly and homey. It is meant to be a home away from home for travelers! We believe there are still many stories left to be told, and we invite you back to the old telephone central to share yours.
